Steps to run `main.py`

Prerequisites:
- make sure typing `python` in the terminal works, and Python version is >= 3.9.6. 
- Note: May also work with older Python versions but I haven't tested it with other versions

Steps:
- go to the project root on your command line 
- Install the deps using `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Then run `python src/main.py`
